 # Should I use it?
By adopting Combine, you’ll make your code easier to read and maintain, by centralizing your event-processing code and eliminating troublesome techniques like nested closures and convention-based callbacks.   -[Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)

 	
 ### Bare in mind
 - event-driven architecture
 - understand event flow across project
 - get the whole team onboard
 - difficult to debug
 - iOS 13+
 - is it a new pattern in your app? do you need it?
